## Data Processing
Cyrillic App operates **entirely on your device**.
All text input and converted output remain local and are **never sent** to us or to any third party.
We have **no access** to your text or usage data.

Cyrillic App may optionally copy converted text to your device’s clipboard for convenience. This feature is entirely local and no clipboard data is sent to us or any third party. Please note that text in your clipboard may be accessible to other apps while it remains there.

Because all processing happens locally on your device, **no personal data is collected or processed** by the developer under the meaning of the EU GDPR.

## In-App Purchases
Our app may offer optional in-app purchases.
All transactions are processed securely through **Google Play Billing** or **Apple’s In‑App Purchase system**.
We do not have access to, nor do we collect or store, any personal payment information such as your name, credit card number, or billing address.
Google and Apple provide us only with anonymized transaction identifiers and status information (e.g., confirmation of purchase or refund) to deliver the purchased content.

For more information about how Google processes your payment data, please refer to [Google’s Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy).
For more information about how Apple processes your payment data, please refer to [Apple’s Privacy Policy](https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/).

### Ads & Tracking
The app contains **no ads** and performs **no tracking or analytics**.
